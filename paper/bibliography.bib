abstract = {Summary This chapter investigates the particular challenges for joint inversion in the context of hydrocarbon exploration. It reviews the current literature and introduces interesting approaches that have been developed in the context of hydrocarbon exploration and could potentially be used in other application areas as well. Joint inversion methods incorporating petro physical models of the reservoir can directly yield quantities of interest such as porosity and permeability, but have to be carefully tuned to the area under investigation. The chapter presents two detailed joint inversion case studies, one for subsalt imaging and one for sub basalt imaging. It also covers emulation of the forward calculation, a concept that can be applied generally in joint inversion, but has only been applied in hydrocarbon exploration. For a successful joint inversion, it is necessary to invert each dataset, construct different coupling approaches, and evaluate the impact on the final results.}

@inproceedings{Bournas,
	Abstract = { In this paper, we propose a new exploration strategy for detecting pipe-like structures from airborne TDEM data. We first apply the Keating's pattern recognition technique to the EM resistive limit calculated from the early and mid-time decay channels and to the magnetic analytic signal for predicting conductive and magnetic pipes. The automated detection procedure yielded numerous solutions, whose number is downsized after a careful screening and fine-tuning of the obtained results. Further, the selected targets are classified into several categories according to their EM, magnetic and IP signatures. Finally, we perform 3D MVI and 1D EM inversions on selected targets to determine the size, the depth and the magnetic and electrical properties of these targets.Presentation Date: Wednesday, October 17, 2018Start Time: 1:50:00 PMLocation: 213B (Anaheim Convention Center)Presentation Type: Oral },

@inproceedings{Schmidt2,
	Abstract = {Markov Random Fields (MRFs) are a popular and well-motivated model for many medical image processing tasks such as segmentation. Discriminative Random Fields (DRFs), a discriminative alternative to the traditionally generative MRFs, allow tractable computation with less restrictive simplifying assumptions, and achieve better performance in many tasks. In this paper, we investigate the tumor segmentation performance of a recent variant of DRF models that takes advantage of the powerful Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method. Combined with a powerful Magnetic Resonance (MR) preprocessing pipeline and a set of `alignment-based' features, we evaluate the use of SVMs, MRFs, and two types of DRFs as classifiers for three segmentation tasks related to radiation therapy target planning for brain tumors, two of which do not rely on `contrast agent' enhancement. Our results indicate that the SVM-based DRFs offer a significant advantage over the other approaches.},

@article{Grana2017,
	Abstract = {A Bayesian linear inversion methodology based on Gaussian mixture models and its application to geophysical inverse problems are presented in this paper. The proposed inverse method is based on a Bayesian approach under the assumptions of a Gaussian mixture random field for the prior model and a Gaussian linear likelihood function. The model for the latent discrete variable is defined to be a stationary first-order Markov chain. In this approach, a recursive exact solution to an approximation of the posterior distribution of the inverse problem is proposed. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm can be used to efficiently simulate realizations from the correct posterior model. Two inversion studies based on real well log data are presented, and the main results are the posterior distributions of the reservoir properties of interest, the corresponding predictions and prediction intervals, and a set of conditional realizations. The first application is a seismic inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, P- and S-impedance, where an improvement of 30{\%} in the root-mean-square error of the predictions compared to the traditional Gaussian inversion is obtained. The second application is a rock physics inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, porosity, and clay volume, where predictions slightly improve compared to the Gaussian inversion approach.},

@article{Onizawa2002,
	Abstract = {We have developed a method for three-dimensional simultaneous velocity and density inversion using traveltimes of local earthquakes and gravity data. The purpose of this method is to constrain the velocity inversion and increase the spatial resolution of shallow velocity structures by introducing additional gravity data. The gravity data contributes to the P- and S-wave velocity models by imposing constraints between seismic velocities and density. The constraint curve is constructed so as to fit the data for porous rock samples, and deviations from the curve are taken into account in the inversion. The constraint is imposed at only the first layer, because density structure is well resolved at shallower parts and it is difficult to determine uniquely at greater depths. Synthetic inversion tests indicate that gravity data can improve the resolution of the velocity models for this layer. The method is applied to investigate the subsurface structure of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan and velocity structures with high spatial resolution are obtained. The additional gravity data contribute primarily to improvement of the S-wave velocity model. At 0.25 km depth, a high velocity anomaly due to caldera-filling lava flows is observed. At 1.25 and 2.5 km depths, high velocity intrusive bodies are detected. A NW-SE trending high velocity belt at 1.25 km depth is interpreted as being caused by repeated intrusion of dikes.},

@article{Haber1997,
	Abstract = {We develop a methodology to invert two different data sets with the assumption that the underlying models have a common structure. Structure is defined in terms of absolute value of curvature of the model and two models are said to have common structure if the changes occur at the same physical locations. The joint inversion is solved by defining an objective function which quantifies the difference in structure between two models, and then minimizing this objective function subject to satisfying the data constraints. The problem is nonlinear and is solved iteratively using Krylov space techniques. Testing the algorithm on synthetic data sets shows that the joint inversion is superior to individual inversions. In an application to field data we show that the data sets are consistent with models that are quite similar.},
